When trying to implement numpy arrays in the computational heavy bits, and comparing it with standard Python lists, it actually seems like using numpy is slower. 
This was done by using 10000,62500, 250000, 562600, 1000000 and 4000000 points. 
Every simulation shows that the runtime using standard Python is slightly faster.
